# Symptom Tracker

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/ChelseaDH/symptom-tracker/android.yml?branch=main)

A simple food and symptom tracker to help identify patterns between what you eat and how you feel.
Logs your meals, snacks, symptoms and movements, and provides a simple interface to review the data.

This app was built by me for my own use, but I'm sharing it in case it's useful to others. It's a
work in progress, so there are definitely bugs and missing features üêõ.

Build
using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room),
and [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android#hilt-and-dagger).

food logs.
